# DUPnet-Pytorch
A water body segmentation method based on dense blocks and the multi-scale pyramid pooling module (DUPnet) are proposed. We analyzed the water segmentation performance of dupnet on two datasets: the LR dataset and the 2020 Gaofen challenge water body segmentation dataset.

1. we create a new dataset called Landsat River dataset (LR dataset) to evaluate the per-formance of the proposed network. Images from Landsat 8 satellite were downloaded freely from the USGS website (https://earthexplorer.usgs.gov/, accessed on 24 August 2022). The LR dataset contains 7,154 images with the size of 128Ã—128.This dataset was partitioned into training, validation, and test sets with a scale of 6:2:2.

2. The dataset contains 1000 RGB images from the GF-2 satellite with an image size of 492 x 492. We expanded to 8,000 images by rotating, blurring, brightening, darkening, and adding noise. This dataset was partitioned into training, validation, and test sets with a scale of 6:2:2.
